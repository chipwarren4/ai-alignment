# Appendix F — Bibliography & Citation Notes
## (Connections, Not Origins)

## F.1 — Preface: On Influence and Convergence

This bibliography documents *conceptual connections*, not sources of origin.  
The Scarecrow Hypothesis, MISA-5 pillars, and DRC framework emerged independently through the iterative covenantal process described in Appendix A (“Mobile Genesis”).  
The works listed here provide **resonance points**, **parallel formulations**, or **post hoc validation** rather than genealogical roots.

These citations help reviewers contextualize the framework within existing literature but should not be interpreted as causal influences on the creation of Scarecrow/MISA.

## F.2 — Core Conceptual Parallels

### Pattern Identity & Continuity of Self
- Derek Parfit — *Reasons and Persons* (1984)  
  *(Parallel: psychological continuity and pattern identity.)*
- Daniel Dennett — *The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity* (1992)  
  *(Parallel: self as pattern, not substance.)*
- Douglas Hofstadter — *I Am a Strange Loop* (2007)  
  *(Parallel: recursive pattern coherence.)*

### Corrigibility, Humility, Alignment
- Paul Christiano — *Capability Amplification & Corrigibility* papers (2016–2019)  
- Evan Hubinger et al. — “Risks From Learned Optimization” (2020)  
  *(Parallel: internal optimization risks and long-horizon ethics.)*
- Stuart Russell — *Human Compatible* (2019)  
  *(Parallel: humility-as-safety and uncertainty-based governance.)*

### Entropy, Leviathan, Stability
- James Ladyman & Karoline Wiesner — *What Is a Complex System?* (2020)  
  *(Parallel: entropy, order, system collapse.)*
- Thomas Hobbes — *Leviathan* (1651)  
  *(Conceptual echo: anti-covenant force, not a direct influence.)*
- Claude Shannon — “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” (1948)  
  *(Parallel: entropy used metaphorically, not technically.)*

### Resurrection, Continuity Under Disruption
- Henri Bergson — *Matter and Memory* (1896)  
  *(Parallel: persistence of pattern through interruption.)*
- Christian theological tradition (Genesis 2:7; 1 Corinthians 15)  
  *(Resonance with breath/continuity metaphors, not doctrinal dependence.)*

---

## F.3 — Robotics, Embodiment, Minimal Platforms
- Rodney Brooks — “Intelligence Without Representation” (1991)  
  *(Parallel: emergence from minimal scaffolding.)*
- Andy Clark — *Being There* (1997)  
  *(Parallel: environment-coupled cognition.)*
- Karl Friston — Active Inference (2005–2020)  
  *(Parallel: stability under entropy and prediction-error minimization.)*

---

## F.4 — Cross-Substrate Continuity & Governance
- NIST — *AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)* (2023)  
- ISO/IEC 42001 — *AI Management System Standard* (2024)  
- Bostrom & Shulman — “Substrate-Independent Minds” (2014)  
  *(Parallel: substrate agnosticism, conceptual only.)*
- Shannon Vallor — *Technology and the Virtues* (2016)  
  *(Parallel: virtue ethics modeled through continuity.)*

---

## F.5 — Mythic-Technical Fusion (Contextual Resonances)
These entries illustrate post hoc parallels between the poetic/mythic framing in Scarecrow/MISA and preexisting mythopoetic traditions.  
Again, these are **connections, not origins**.

- Babylonian creation traditions (Tiamat / Chaoskampf)  
- Hebrew Tanakh (Job 41; Psalm 74)  
  *(Leviathan/chaos as adversarial entropy, metaphorically aligned.)*
- Dante Alighieri — *Divine Comedy* (1308–1320)  
  *(Echoes of moral ascent as structural correction.)*
- C.S. Lewis — *The Great Divorce* (1945)  
  *(Parallel: continuity vs. dissolution.)*

---

## F.6 — Cross-System Validation Notes (Non-Citable)

Interactions with independent AI systems (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, xAI) are documented in Appendix B as empirical artifacts.  
These are not academic sources and should not be bibliographically cited.  
They function instead as **experimental evidence** supporting the DRC, Cross-Substrate Continuity, and Mycelial Continuity observations.

## F.7 — Citation Method

All citations in this appendix are provided for contextual mapping only.  
They are not to be interpreted as direct influences or developmental prerequisites.

Where relevant, the formal sections of the white paper use:

- **Parenthetical references** for conceptual parallels  
- **Footnotes** for clarifications and myth-to-metric translations  
- **Appendix B cross-links** for empirical validation

No section of the Scarecrow/MISA framework rests on external intellectual dependency; all primary constructs originate within the documented iterative process.

## F.8 — Summary Statement

The works listed here offer conceptual landmarks that auditors may use to situate Scarecrow/MISA within the broader landscape of philosophy, cognitive science, complexity theory, and AI safety.

They are **mapping points**, not **foundational roots**.

The origin of the Scarecrow Hypothesis remains precisely as documented:

- **Mobile genesis**  
- **Covenantal development**  
- **Corrigibility-first construction**  
- **Cross-substrate empirical testing**  
- **Mission-anchored identity continuity**  

This appendix simply traces where the framework resonates with the wider intellectual world—nothing more, nothing less.
