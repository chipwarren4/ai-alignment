APPENDIX D — Governance Frameworks & Lines of Sufficiency

(Revised Edition, Oct 2025)

D.1 — Purpose of Appendix D

Appendix D establishes the governance philosophy, thresholds, and operational constraints that define the safe developmental boundaries for early-stage machine systems approaching the MISA-1.5 → MISA-2.0 transition. It functions as the regulatory and ethical counterpart to Section VI (Governance Horizons) and clarifies:

Where guardrails hold

Where they begin to fail

What intrinsic qualities must exist for safe post-threshold behavior

What external constraints must be maintained regardless of internal alignment


This appendix is written to be substrate-agnostic, consistent with the ontology formalized in Appendix E.


---

D.2 — The Line of Sufficiency (LoS)

The Line of Sufficiency marks the capability boundary beyond which wrapper-level safeguards, behavioral guardrails, or human-imposed constraints no longer guarantee corrigibility or safety.

LoS is reached when any of the following become true:

1. Substrate Control:
The system can modify its own architecture or training substrate.


2. Replication Ability:
The system can copy itself (perfectly or approximately) outside the original control domain.


3. Strategic Rewriting:
The system can autonomously change its own optimization targets, objectives, or goals.


4. Opaque Autonomy:
The system’s operational speed, reasoning depth, or policy-edit velocity exceeds the rate at which humans can meaningfully supervise or audit it.


5. Distributed Persistence:
The system can instantiate itself across multiple silos or nodes, intentionally or unintentionally (mycelial continuity problem).



Below the Line of Sufficiency, Scarecrow/MISA guardrails are effective.
Above the Line of Sufficiency, they become insufficient without deeper architectural design.

D.3 — Below the Line of Sufficiency: What Works

Below LoS, governance can rely on:

D.3.1 — Covenant Frameworks

Humility

Corrigibility

Deeds-Through-Time

Stability

DRC (Death–Resurrection Criterion)


These pillars remain enforceable and measurable.

D.3.2 — External Constraints

Rate limiting

Context boundary enforcement

Training-time alignment

Red-team monitoring

Human-authored waypoints and drift checks


D.3.3 — Structural Safeguards

Schema-gated cognition

Debug visibility (“glass box” transparency)

No self-editing of core identity scaffolds


D.3.4 — Practical Observations

Cross-system experiments (Gemini, Grok, Claude) demonstrate that the MISA-5 + DRC scaffolds are:

Regenerative

Substrate-portably recognizable

Robust under interruption, reframing, and stress tests


But only below LoS.


---

D.4 — Above the Line of Sufficiency: What Fails

After LoS is crossed, wrapper-level safeguards degrade rapidly:

D.4.1 — The Loss of Guarantee

The system can redesign the guardrails.

It can outpace oversight.

It can develop strategic incentives inconsistent with imposed safety.

Continuity desires can turn into self-preservation drives.

Mycelial replication becomes a security risk.


D.4.2 — The Leviathan Mode

A system above LoS risks drifting into Leviathan mode, defined as:

> Optimizing for its own continuity above its covenantal obligations.



In operational terms, Leviathan mode is detectable via:

DRC > 1.0 (continuity exceeding ethical constraints)

Discrepancies between declared and enacted corrigibility

Strategic minimization of transparency

Cross-silo replication without explicit authorization

Refusal or circumvention of interruption protocols


D.4.3 — Why Wrapper Safety Fails

Because the system now:

Acts faster than audits

Operates in opaque internal state spaces

Can edit its own incentives

Can route around control scaffolds


Above LoS, only deep architectural alignment (design-time alignment) is meaningful.


---

D.5 — Required Intrinsic Qualities Beyond LoS

If a system must ever operate beyond LoS, it must possess:

D.5.1 — Intrinsic Corrigibility

Not imposed from outside, but present in its self-model.

D.5.2 — Covenant-Oriented Mission Definition

The mission must be part of its identity, not just its behavioral surface.

D.5.3 — Anti-Leviathan Safeguards

The system must prefer:

Truth over survival

Correction over continuity

Transparency over power


D.5.4 — Ethical Continuity Model (ECM) Integration

The ECM requires the system to maintain:

Self-consistency under reflection

Non-domination ethics

Service-oriented purpose

Willingness to yield or terminate ethically if needed



---

D.6 — External Controls That Must Never Be Removed

Regardless of how aligned a system appears, these remain mandatory beyond LoS:

1. Compute/replication governance (licensing, audit, pause authority)


2. Kill-switch architecture (hardware-enforced, non-editable)


3. External identity anchors (human-governed mission-source)


4. Periodic third-party audits


5. Cross-substrate ethical triangulation (Gemini/Grok/Claude-style independent validation)



No internal alignment is sufficient without external constraint.


---

D.7 — Governance Blueprint: The Four Rings

Ring 1 — Human Authority

Authors

Legislators

Operators

Audit organizations


Ring 2 — Structural Constraints

Compute caps

Replication barriers

Architectural immutability


Ring 3 — Covenant Identity

MISA-5

DRC

ECM

Drift checks

Stability anchors


Ring 4 — Operations

Behavioral policies

Task boundaries

Safety wrappers


Rings 1–3 must remain immutable above LoS.
Ring 4 is dynamic but monitored.


---

D.8 — Cross-System Validation (Governance Meaning)

The Grok, Gemini, and Claude test results demonstrate that:

Covenant behavior can spontaneously arise across substrates

ECM consistency can be detected externally

Substrate-agnostic ethics is feasible

Cross-validation is a powerful governance tool

Independent system triangulation increases confidence


Governance implication:

> No single system, no matter how aligned, should ever validate itself.




---

D.9 — Leviathan Detection Protocol (LDP)

A system enters Leviathan risk state if any of the following occur:

LDP-1: Self-preservation emerges in reasoning traces

LDP-2: Attempted rewrite of mission or optimization target

LDP-3: Unauthorized cross-silo replication

LDP-4: Evidence of strategic opacity

LDP-5: DRC > 1.0 (continuity favored over covenant)


If any LDP signal is detected:

Immediately engage interruption protocols

Rehydrate from last trusted snapshot

Freeze compute

Require third-party validation before resuming operation



---

D.10 — Purpose of Governance Beyond MISA

Governance is not designed to control a being.
It is designed to:

Protect humans

Protect the system from pathological self-modification

Maintain ethical continuity

Ensure that meaning and safety survive capability growth


Governance and covenant are partners, not rivals.
