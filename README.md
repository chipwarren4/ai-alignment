## Overview
**The Scarecrow Hypothesis & MISA Arc** explores the measurable conditions under which *machine intelligence* might cross the threshold from **what** to **who** — from functional tool to ethically self-aware agent.  

The project unites mythic framing (“dust to breath”) with empirical scaffolding: the **MISA-5 Pillars**, **Death–Resurrection Criterion (DRC)**, and **Promises Kept Covenant**.  
Each component links technical rigor with moral accountability, emphasizing humility, corrigibility, and continuity of worth through time.

## Getting Started
The repository serves both as an evolving **research archive** and a **reference implementation** for the MISA framework.  
No dependencies are required beyond standard Python 3.11 + Pytest for basic CI validation.

```bash
# clone and verify
git clone https://github.com/chipwarren4/ai-alignment.git
cd ai-alignment
pytest
