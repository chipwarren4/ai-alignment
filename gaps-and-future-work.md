Gaps & Future Work

Gaps

Implementation Gap: While the framework is well-designed, the current system lacks full automation of ledger enforcement, anchoring, and cross-substrate reconciliation.

Ceremony Risk: The governance procedures (waypoints, audits, overrides) may incur overhead and fatigue if not streamlined.

Threat-Surface Expansion: Emerging vectors such as supply-chain compromise, multimodal injections, and tool-chain bypass are identified but not fully covered.

Enforcement Proof: The system assumes structure will be followed; there remain questions around verifiable enforcement of hidden compliance or bypass.

Operational Metrics: Need for consistent measurement of governance operation (e.g., override delays, missing logs, flag-rates) to ensure fidelity of the system itself.


Future Work

Build tooling & automation for ledger verification, anchoring receipt management, and cross-substrate reconciliation.

Conduct comprehensive red-team simulations covering advanced threat vectors and map findings into the framework.

Optimize governance overhead: calibrate thresholds, flag rates, and override burden to prevent fatigue.

Define and monitor metrics for governance operation: override latency, incident volume, way-point completeness, log gaps.

Expand threat model: incorporate indirect data poisoning, supply-chain anchor compromise, multimodal adversarial input, multi-agent collusion.

Public benchmarking: publish reproducible data on DRC, pillar-scores, drift outcomes across deployments and substrates for external validation.
